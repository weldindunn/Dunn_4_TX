                    <p>
                        I have lived in Houston for most of my life. I was born in Beaumont, TX and grew up outside
                        the city with my parents (a hairdresser from Baton Rouge and a roughneck from Beaumont) as 
                        well as my two younger brothers. After high school I attended University of Houston where 
                        I earned by Bachelor's Degree in Physics. It has always been my passion to understand the 
                        world around us and be able to explore and improve upon it. This lead me to earn my PhD in
                        astrophysics from the University of Illinois.
                        <br><br>
                        After the 9/11 Attacks I joined the Air Force to become a fighter pilot. I consider my time
                        served in the military among the best in my life. In 2005, I applied to become an astronaut 
                        and went on to serve in two ISS missions. No surprise, this is where I earned my nickname,
                        "Space Cowboy" Ten years later, I retired from NASA to be closer with my wife and sons here 
                        in Houston. 
                        <br><br>
                        Four years later, I was elected to the US House in 2018 of Representatives as the first Democrat 
                        in my district since the 1960s. With such an awesome responsibility, I have made my mission
                        similar to the others of my life:<br>To serve alongside the great people of Houston. 
                        <br><br>
                        Together, we are an unprecedented power in business, energy, and world trade.
