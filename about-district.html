                        Formerly represented by President George HW Bush, TX-07 encompasses
                        West Houston and its suburbs. I believe there is no place that breeds
                        innovation and business better than Houston. But don't take my word for it:
                        Houston has the second most Fortune-500 headquarters in the US behind only 
                        New York City, and it shows no signs of slowing as more and more companies move their
                        manufacturing plants and headquarters. The Port of Houston ranks
                        first in waterborne cargo handled, and do I even have to bring up the Astros' record?
                        Diversity is one of our greatest strengths as a nation, and we exemplify that
                        better than any other city as the most ethnically diverse metropolis in the US.
                        <br><br>
                        Houston is best known for its role as the center of the oil industry. While oil and 
                        energy play a large part in Houston's economy, it is a small fraction of what we have 
                        to offer. As previously mentioend, trade is a massive part of the economy as Houston one 
                        of the largest trade hubs in the US. The healthcare and aerospace industries also
                        play key roles in our economy. Houston hosts what I see as one of the most important
                        buildings of the 20th century and beyond: The Johnson Space Center. I spent thousands
                        of hours training there for my missions, and as we all know, when there is a problem 
                        in space, Houston is the first to hear about it.
                        <br><br>
                        As the saying goes, everything is bigger in Texas, and the truth is that Houston has 
                        everything to offer the world. I fell in love with her during college and have never
                        looked away since.
